Twitter Sentiment Analysis
#Overview
This project is a Twitter Sentiment Analysis tool that leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This tool can be used for various applications, including social media monitoring, brand analysis, and market research.

#Features
Data Collection: Collect tweets in real-time using the Twitter API based on specific hashtags or keywords.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the tweet text by removing stop words, handling hashtags, mentions, URLs, and performing tokenization.
Sentiment Analysis: Use various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) to classify the sentiment of each tweet.
#Visualization: Generate visualizations such as word clouds, sentiment distribution graphs, and time series plots to understand trends over time.
Deployment: Option to deploy the model using a web framework (like Flask) to create a simple web app for public use.
